### Frontal Face Extraction
The person representation used in this paper are extracted by a 2D pose estimator and a human parser:
The frontal face used in this code are extracted by dlib library:
* [dlib C++ library](https://github.com/davisking/dlib)

### Dataset
The dataset is 3 videos of Barack Obama, Harry Potter and Andrew Ng which can be download from Youtube. For this project, I trimmed the video to target-face only video for easy frontal face extraction. The video is put together in this repo, however, can get directly the image set I used from ```face.zip```. \\
